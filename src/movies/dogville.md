Among a fairly large number of people, there is a widespread opinion that one cannot judge a person, and forgiveness characterizes us, first of all, as generous people, standing at the highest level of spiritual development. The roots of these ideas originate from ancient Christian teachings - we all remember well what needs to be done if we were hit on the cheek.

Grace is the main character of the film "Dogville". She is just a typical representative of such views. Having escaped from her cruel bandit father, she finds herself in a small town, whose inhabitants at first bribe her with their hospitality and desire to help their guest. However, each of them is revealed in a new way soon. In a fairly short period of time they turn from sweet and friendly people into real sadists, each of which pursues the most vile and selfish goals in relation to an innocent girl. And as Grace forgives them every time and finds an excuse for yet another mockery, the more terrible the consequences become, more and more approaching the story of the ill-fated Justine from the book of the Marquis de Sade.

A distinctive feature of the film is that it completely lacks any scenery. The walls here are replaced with white lines on the floor, and each individual room is marked with inscriptions. I met quite a few criticisms about this. They say that because of this the movie loses its rather important cinematic part. However, on the other hand, this allows us to draw our attention to the most important thing, to put forward the author's idea, the essence of which is almost completely reflected in Grace's dialogue with her father, who came to take her away from the clutches of the residents of Dogville, distraught with impunity. Their further dialogue is, in fact, the quintessence of the whole idea of ​​the film.

Her father accuses Grace of being arrogant, and at first this causes shock and surprise in her. To the statement that all actions without exception should entail responsibility, she states that no one gave anyone the right to judge and punish. But isn't pardon the same exclusive right of a judge as punishment? If we are endowed with the moral right to issue only acquittals, then we do not exclude ourselves from the role of a judge, we still judge, but at the same time we do it very one-sidedly, with unknown and often dangerous consequences for ourselves and others.

Each of us, of course, is free to agree with this or not. In my opinion, the truth, as always, is in a very fragile balance.
There is an animal nature in us and the whole human history is the history of our struggle with it. Such is the nature of things. And then we win, then we succumb to our vices and weaknesses. And this is just as natural as the fact that we will be responsible for each of our actions, whether it be positive or negative for ourselves.

Pardon entails the same burden of responsibility as punishment. And first of all, before leaving someone's act unpunished, it is worth considering whether such a decision is dictated by arrogance, are we really so spiritual and merciful, or just want to appear so? And even if we are, then, as Grace's father notes, will it be fair to pardon Dogville in relation to other cities that do not commit all that horror that did not follow their blind self-interest and animal nature. And after all, wouldn't this punishment make life of others just better and safier? What else is true power for, if not just to make this world a better place?
